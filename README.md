InventoryNexus is a robust, enterprise-grade backend engine designed to serve as a central "Nexus" for multi-channel commerce. It acts as the single source of truth for orders and inventory, bridging the gap between major marketplaces (Amazon, Shopify, etc.) and modern frontend applications (React, Angular).

Built with a "Security-First" philosophy, InventoryNexus is designed to be compliant with **NIST 800-53** standards when deployed in a qualified environment.
